    <h2>What are the benefits of version control?</h2>
      <p>
        From the get-go, version control allows for less logistical errors that arise when you're working on team and you can't find the right file to update, or end up simply updating a file that wasn't the latest version everyone else was working on. Having a teeam working on the most up to date file ensures that multiple copies aren't flying around via email or that crazy edits aren't ruining the whatever streamlines process has been created for working on a file. Version control, in this scenario, is very much sanity-inducing.

    <h2>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
      <p>
          Keeping track of changes using git allows for multiple instances of a file to stay in communication while not only you are working on it but multiple members of your team. When you have git software functioning on your system, you are making it possible for your system to take a series of snapshots of your code/file. If you need to experiment of work out some other bits of information, you can create branches, or other paths that your code will flow through, before adding it back in to a pristine version of a master code/file.

    <h2>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h2>
      <p>
          GitHub, by extension, allows one to not only upload those files you're working on locally, to their site but to also open up the code to that wonderful community. On GitHub you publish your code for a worldwide community to collaborate with you and, most importantly, potentially improve your initial coding efforts. It's the best of both worlds!
