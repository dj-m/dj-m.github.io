      <p>So here’s the problem… you want to store some data that you can access for specific situations, but there’s two ways to do this (in programming). Huh?</p>
      <h3 id="different">
        I know, it’s still pretty shaky to me, but here’s where I’m at:
      </h3>
      <p>One method of collecting this data is in an array. An array is a list much like you’d make for grocery shopping. Let’s say you have soymilk, lettuce and almonds on your shopping list. You can access or look up the values of your list based on where in that list your grocery item is located.</p>
      <p>So, your array, let’s call it ‘shopping_array’ has 3 items. You may want to know what the first item in the list is and using shopping_array[0] would give you “soymilk.” The second item would be “lettuce” using shopping_array[1].</p>
      <p>You may have noticed that the first item in an array is referenced by 0 rather than 1. It’s super important to remember that this will usually be the case for any lists. Counting starts from 0.</p>
      <p>Now a hash is a list, but of paired items. Each pair has a name and a value. The name, or ‘key’, must be unique to each value paired with it.</p>
      <p>So, for instance, if soymilk was on your grocery list, then ‘vanilla’ or ‘coffee’ flavor would be next to that. In this example ‘soymilk’ is the key for ‘vanilla’. Instead of a list, think of this structure as more akin to a table than a simpler grocery list.</p>
      <p>What’s important with hashes isn’t so much the order, but what’s paired with the values.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p>Your grocery list array might look like so:</p>
      <p>shopping_list = [“soymilk”, “lettuce”, “almonds”]</p>
      <p>A grocery hash may look like so:</p>
      <p>specific_list = [“soymilk” => “low-fat”, “lettuce” => “romaine”, “almonds” => “unsalted”]</p>
      <p>In this case, the “soymilk”, “lettuce” and “almonds” would be your key and the “low-fat”, “romaine” and “unsalted” would be your value, respectively.</p>
      <p>Lookups:</p>
      <p>To lookup information from your array, you would type the following:</p>
      <p>shopping_list[2] and get “almonds”</p>
      <p>While in a hash, you’d type the following:</p>
      <p>specific_list[“almonds”] and get “unsalted”</p>
      <p>I’ve found that labs.codecademy helps solidify some of this. Have at it!</p>
