      <h2>Sorting...</h2>

      <p>Here's a bit about sorting... it's REALLY important. Efficient sorting is the bedrock of making sure other algorithms work! So, here, I'll discuss just 3 different kinds of sorting... as a taste.</p>

      <h3 id="different">Merge Sort</h3>

      <p>A merge sort creates a new list from two or more pre-existing sorted lists. This method of sorting compares every two elements, a with b and c with d, and then merges those two lists of two into four. Ultimately this will merge into a final sorted list. This is the standard sort routine of programming languages like Python, Java and Perl.</p>

      <h3 id="different">Quick Sort</h3>

      <p>This method of sorting, uses a more divid and conquer approach by partitioning an array of elements along a pivot. Everything smaller than the pivot are moved before the pivot and everything larger, comes after. The lesser and larger lists are then sorted. Implementations of this sort, as the name implies, are among the fastest sorting algorithms in use.</p>

      <h3 id="different">Bubble Sort</h3>

      <p>This kind of sorting method, while fancifully named are actually simpler than the prior two methods. Bubble sort compares the first element in an array to the second and swapping them if the second is less than the first. It goes along doing this with adjacent pairs of elements. When it reaches the end, it will start again from the beginning enacting the same swapping approach on pairs of elements. It then continues until no swap was done on elements in the prior comparison. Because of the method used for comparing elements, this sorting method is best used for a smaller number of elements out of order or a large set of elements out of order but not too disordered.</p>

      <p>I hope that was super useful!</p>
