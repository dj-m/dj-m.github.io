    <h2>What's your take on the DBC experience?</h2>
      <p>
          The DBC mindset as a 'restaurant' / 'kitchen' and the encouragement to move on from the consumer mode to that of the creator mode, or the growing sense of responsibility over the kind of experience one has at DBC is very galvanizing. It's great to have that driving force to serve as the guiding practice to how I can do this work. Moving from taking DBC as an entire package can be difficult, especially given all the rewarding that happens when we take on the roles of 'typical' students, employees & customers. I found that shift of framing quite enlightening and completely... again, enlivening.
      </p>
    <h2>What's your impression of DBC?</h2>
      <p>
          I find that the pitch of DBC, to make that creator or hacker kind of person, speaks directly to my hope that I can begin to move those semi-solidified tropes of being a student into what a web developer calls me to do. I'm incredibly grateful that I have an environment that almost begs of me to make mistakes and fall/stumble towards my goals. I like this approach!
      </p>
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
      <p>
          I believe what will resonate with me most, and what has been keeping me up at night (somewhat), is that I don't come across the issue of 'banking' or just packing on concepts/teachings on top of one another with little to no understanding but just rote memorization. I believe that working with a pair, or in a very conversational, if not visual approach will help tremendously to help move away from memorizing to understanding. I'm really looking forward to engaging on this community-front!
      </p>
    <h2>Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?</h2>
      <p>
          I believe my expectations haven't changed dramatically, but the blank spots of how certain aspects of the organization works, have been filled in. I found the fireside chat to be great for laying down the expectations of DBC for me. I found that the approach to how a class/cohort is run to be illuminating with respect to what learning at DBC will entail. I'm sweating already!
      </p>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</h2>
      <p>
          The manner in which one can self-assess and really gauge where you are and what happens to catch up or know if you're on the right path is a great opportunity to jump on board and take this education by the reigns. I'm excited and am looking forward to working through those rough spots I'll have when shifting my learning approaches from what was expected/rewarded in a typical student & teacher atmosphere.
      </p>
    <h2>Does it make you nervous?</h2>
      <p>
          Absolutely! The nerves aren't so much based out of any fear of failure nor somehow feeling like I wouldn't be able to measure up to what the demands of the program are... although, I'm sure it will take some time for me to ramp up into the time demands of the curriculum. I believe the nerves come from the perceived departure, and the relative scope of the departure, from my day-to-day job in the public health arena. While I've dabbled in tech and have been very interested in the general movement that tech bloggers & reporters comments on, I haven't actually taken this fork in the road yet. We'll see!
