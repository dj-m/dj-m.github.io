      <h2>Conflict...</h2>

      <h3>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h3>
      <p>There was a point in my undergraduate studies at a self-described 'liberal', upstate NY university, where part of the freshman curriculum called for undergoing an introductory sociology course. During one session, students were asked to denote their backgrounds, and what helped them decide on that particular school to attend for their university studies. As the discussion progressed, several students who'd come from NYC commented at how different it was to be in upstate NY and just how different everything was, by comparison. Several of the students, particularly those who's parents were able to pay for their $35K/year tuition, didn't find it fair that several other students, who were part of a new diversity initiative, were able to attend this university with little, to no personal funds paying for their tuition. To the full-paying students, these other disenfranchised students, were individuals who didn't identify as 'American' but still wanted to 'benefit' from the system. The other set of students, myself included found the efforts of those privileged students, particularly to demerit the pursuits of others, because 'they couldn't pay for it' to be thinly veiled racism, xenophobia and elitist.</p>
      <h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>
      <p>Essentially, the more priviliged students perceived the remarks of how different upstate NY was, to be a statement on how much better the lives of those from NYC was than their own. This misperceived slight, triggered whatever insecurities they had at brown folks being near them who shared lived experiences they had no grasp on than what they'd seen on television. Choosing to deflect and direct their misunderstanding into anger at those students from NYC, rather than try to find the similarities between them and the other students, at a place far from home. I found their 'supposed offense' at me claiming that I considered myself Dominican first, and American second to be laughable and utterly misguided in looking upon someone with a different value system as their own in a lesser light. I found myself quickly retaliating by pointing out their racism and xenophobia as the very reason such a diversity initiative existed in the first place. They did not take kindly to being labelled racists and xenophobes.</p>
      <h3>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h3>
      <p>Initially, there was a glint of shame or a self pity at somehow being seen as lesser and undeserving of the great fortune of being able to attend a private university. I found myself confused that someone, who barely knew me, considered me wholly unfit for being in their company. I found myself quite angry at the outright suggestion that my place in life was somewhere else that better 'suited' to my educational/personal worth. I also felt fear, or rather a fight or flight response that found me wanting to fight these individuals, philosophically/politically (no physically) for what I deemed as my livelihood and survival. </p>
      <h3>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h3>
      <p>Ultimately, the steps employed to solve this conflict, while not resolving it altogether, involved having a diversity panel Q&A put on by the university to show a sign of support, from the university's executive team on why this new diversity intitiative was important. Personally, I found that removing myself from such childish, quick-to-anger individuals proved most rewarding and deescalated the situation.</p>
      <h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
      <p>I would not have participated in the talk, as it was voluntary to be there, and chosen to better coordinate what kinds of questions and topics were going to be discussed with the governing body. </p>
      <h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
      <p>There's never a shortage of opportunities for miscommunication and it seems that finding those avenues via which people can adequately understand another person's point of view and lived experiences in harder than it seems at the outset but is entirely rewarding once achieved.</p>
