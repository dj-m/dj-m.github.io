      <h2>Variable Scope</h2>

      <p>So, what is variable scope? Essentially, variable scope defines where within a program a variable is accessible.</p>
      <h3 id="different">
        Lucky for you, Ruby has four types of variable scope: local, global, instance and class... and 1 constant type!
      </h3>
      <ul class='bullets'>
        <li>If the variable begins with '$' it's a global variable</li>
        <li>If the variable begins with '@' it's an instance variable</li>
        <li>If the variable begins with [a-z] or '_' it's a local variable</li>
        <li>If the variable begins with [A-Z] it's a constant</li>
        <li>If the variable begins with '@@' it's a class variable</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="different">Global Variables</h3>
      <p>These variables are accessible from anywhere in the Ruby program, regardless of where they are declared. Global variable names are prefixed with a dollar sign '$'.</p>
      <h3 id="different">Instance Variables</h3>
      <p>Instance variables are similar to Class variables except that their values are local to specific instances of an object. nstance variables are declared in Ruby by prefixing the variable name with a single '@' sign</p>
      <h3 id="different">Class Variables</h3>
      <p>A class variable is a variable that is shared amongst all instances of a class. This means that only one variable value exists for all objects instantiated from this class.Class variables are declared by prefixing the variable name with two @ characters '@@'.</p>
      <h3 id="different">Constant Scope</h3>
      <p>Ruby constants are values which, once assigned a value, should not be changed. Constants declared within a class or module are available anywhere within the context of that class or module. Constants declared outside of a class or module are assigned global scope.</p>
      <h3 id="different">:::  Quick Tip!  :::</h3>
      <p>Should you ever want to find out the scope of any particular variable just run this bit of code: "defined?" followd by the variabnle. It's super useful!</p>
