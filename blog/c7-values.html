      <p>It's incredibly hard to be in places where you don't feel welcomed. It's even harder to be somewhere where the perception is that one mistake is all that separates you from your downfall and immediate removal of your person. This is where <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">stereotype threat</a> comes into play. Steele & Aronson (1995) found that where your behaviors or manners were perceived as a statement of your entire race (stereotypes) were also places that bore poor outcomes for individuals of color.</p>
      <p>So, what's going on here? Why is this the case? While the specific <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/mechanisms.html">mechanisms</a> are still being researched, there is an understanding that stereotype threat negatively impacts memory, leading to hampering the completion of complex intellectual tasks. However, outside of the biological effects, one can see the sociological impact that feeling like your performance is diminished because of something inherent to you, as an individual can be very psychologically daunting to overcome and suffer through.</p>
      <p>In my own undergraduate, graduate and professional pursuits, I've often found myself to be one of the few, if not the only, person of color. While outright expectations on my behaviors weren't vocalized often, there were so many instances of casual stereotypes that were noted or referenced when I interacted with fellow students or coworkers who were majority: white males & females. Too often, I had to mention to colleagues not to talk down or 'dumb-down' their speech for my own 'perceived benefit'. Too often I've been the one expected to take on the role of 'storyteller' or the 'artistic' role when the technical pursuits were kept out of my reach and consideration. Too often, I've had to defend my thoughts & perceptions above and beyond what other colleagues dealt with out of a tacit reasoning that I wasn't bringing scientific rigor to the table.</p>
      <p>Of note are the findings of the <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_gonzales_blanton_williams.html">Gonzales, Blanton & Williams</a> (2002) study amongst Latino/a students and participants. When the individuals were informed that a particular metric, in this case a math test, would best determine capability in a particular topic, Latinas were found to have worse outcomes than their White counterparts. When uninformed of this test's purpose, Latinas were seen to perform on par or better than their White counterparts. These findings are profound for how unassuming a simple math test seems and yet how greatly powerful of a predictor it was.</p>
      <p>It's critically important to view how something determined as 'objective' can have a tremendous snowball effect. If nothing else, it offers an avenue to profoundly alter the stereotype threat as we've seen it thus far.</p>
