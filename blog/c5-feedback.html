      <p>Diversity in tech has been garnering attention for a bit of time recently and deservedly so, because the disparity is <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/">crazy</a>! At prima facie, that infographic is utterly defeating. It shows just how incredibly lopsided diversity, or rather the lack thereof, is within the context of the technology sector. </p>
      <p>So, what exactly is going on here? Why are those rates & numbers just so damning of a sector that purports to be in the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joelkotkin/2013/01/10/the-new-places-where-americas-tech-future-is-taking-shape/">business of creating the future</a>. Is it possible that people of color (POC) just aren't interested in jumping on board this awesome-future train to rainbows galore and love in the years ahead of us? In the summer of 2014 when companies like Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn & Yahoo released their workforce diversity numbers, it signaled that there was a serious problem with the workforces at these tech giants.</p>
      <p>The tech industry, in particular, adheres to the concept of a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/meritocracy/">meritocracy</a> where ideas rule supreme and you earn your role in an organization based solely on your merit you gain from these very ideas/insights you bring up. While this sounds grounded in concept, especially when you consider that it rings of a 'colorblind' or gender-neutral way to function at an organization, there's an unintended consequence to this. Namely, that if you aren't in a leadership position or being rewarded for you ideas & insights, it's because you don't <a href="http://www.bestoftheleft.com/the_myth_of_meritocracy_economic_update_with_profwolff">deserve it</a>, or merit it.</p>
      <p>What a meritocracy fails to do, is actually recognize or reward the ideas/sights of the non-dominant gender(s) or POC. A recent study found that in performance reviews, organizations that ascribe to functioning under a meritocracy, actually <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdspace.mit.edu%2Fopenaccess-disseminate%2F1721.1%2F65884&ei=ilGzU639Foi8oQSl1ILABw&usg=AFQjCNEWvbtU9vUtaPfe3IK4PeRqyfmEGg&bvm=bv.70138588,d.cGU">reward women less than men</a>. Clearly there's a disconnect between the goals of a 'meritocracy' and what's actually happening. If this system isn't working then there needs to be a fix that will better support diversity in the technology sector.</p>
      <p>There are any number of potential approaches that <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18511">social science</a> has found to drive back tacit systems of inequality. What's needed are what's termed as a 'Bias Interrupter". Here, what you're looking for is a systematized way of breaking down the gender and POC divide of <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7575.html">negotiating</a> for what you are actually worth, in addition to mitigating the inherent double standards of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genderinscience.org%2Findex.php%2Fdownloads%2Fdoc_download%2F104-heilman-and-haynes-2005-no-credit-where-credit-is-due-attributional-rationalization-of-women-s-success-in-male-female-teams&ei=SsjGU-KdC9jhoAST3IKgAg&usg=AFQjCNHkoRm9s5EetaOkjvmVIxH1bBgwAg&bvm=bv.71198958,d.cGU">attribution</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jwOGAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA160&dq=marilyn+brewer+ingroup+favoritism+leniency+bias&ots=uOUvwvvFrw&sig=CkGYBgpyNylA5TznfNfkqFchHZk#v=onepage&q&f=true"leniancy</a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1987-25065-001">recall</a>biases and, again, flawed <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1981-12770-001">performance evaluations</a></p>
      <p>Solving this problem offers the opportunity to reinvent how we value each other beyond just the workplace. When individuals come together to propose solutions, we want to look at those avenues we haven't had the privilege to consider before. Ascribing ourselves to how business-as-usual has done this before won't get us anywhere better than our current doldrums. Looking at the masculine-gendered words of "competitive", "assertive" or "ambitious" when assessing team members, won't get us anywhere close either. We need to have empirical data that paints a clear picture and releasing workforce diversity numbers is just a first step.</p>
