      <h2>Thinking Style & Mindset</h2>

      <p>According to the Gregorc thinking style, developed by <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm">Anthony Gregorc</a> from the University of Connecticut, my thinking style falls evenly between ‘Abstract Random’ & ‘Concrete Random’.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the background of the Gregorc Personal Thinking Style offers 4 different categories that classify thinking styles across 2 axes, Perceptual Quality and Ordering Ability. Perceptual Quality encompases a ‘Concrete’ and an ‘Abstract’ manner of perceiving information from the obvious here and now, as in the case of the former, to a more visual and conceptual method of understanding, in the case of the latter. With ‘Ordering Ability’ your mind may gravitate towards a more linear, step-by-step, approach to organizing information known as Sequential, or in a more random method, with information organized in chunks known as Abstract.</p>
      <p>With my individual thinking styles of Abstract Random & Concrete Random I exist in a world of experimentation. According to the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Learning Web</a>, I’m both an experimenter in terms of my perception quality and I organize information via reflection in an unstructured, people-oriented environments.</p>
      <p>To date, I’ve applied my thinking style(s), in less of a structured manner for Phase 0 of DBC. In many respects I’ve done the work in the manner that was natural to me, which happens to have a title now. Looking back at my approaches it makes sense, mostly. The manner in which I work tends to be by experimenting, i.e. trying out a ton of script options, tweaking and infinitely nudging in order to figure out how something works, by noting the differences in actions between my different codes. It’s very visual. In that regard, I’ve noticed that I like to do this in a private or less public space in order to get the bedrock of the idea solidified in my mind. However, the ‘Abstract Random’ side of myself is more into sharing and collaborating on ideas and methods that  can’t crack via my trial-and-error approach.</p>
      <p>In Phase 0, thus far, finding time for experimentation has been the biggest struggle. Due to the accelerated nature of this phase, my current work entanglements and my personal relationships, sectioning time where I can experiment and truly employ the try-and-fail approach isn’t always possible. I’ve started to block 25 minute increments using the Pomodoro method as my attempt to make sure I’m building in this tinkering time. This is a structured way to do it, and it makes it possible to get super focused in these small-ish amounts of time that feed off my natural inclination towards that dabbling approach.</p>
      <p>Borrowing from the Fixed vs. Growth Mindset of <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/mindset-the-new-psychology-of-success/oclc/58546262&referer=brief_results">Carol Dweck</a>, in order to build a more well-rounded set of skills requires finding new opportunities to challenge myself. Looking at the thinking styles, that would entail developing those more literal, obvious perception styles and step-by-step levels of organizational skills. To do this, a couple of ideas come to mind, primarily using the pomodoro system as well. Initially, it will take slowing down from my throw-everything-I-know-at-it approach and going through challenges more methodically and try planning out how to step through the work… 25 minutes at a time!</p>
      <p>Well… here goes!</p>
