      <h3>Questions... Questions... Questions...</h3>
      <p>Too often, I've noticed that that my questions, and really what I was asking for, was too specific. Now, that doesn't normally sound like a bad thing. You'll quickly hear that the art of asking a good questions stems from specificity and honing your ability to be better at pinpointing a certain thought or concept that's particularly incomprehensible for you. However, I argue that the granularity of my questions were my undoing.</p>

      <h3>Where's this going?</h3>

      <p>The process of getting to a particular answer is what was at the core of my questions but I would focus much more on brevity. I find myself asking for clarification without asking how the particular thought was arrived at, that I needed 'clarification' on. This semi-avoidance on asking the right question stemmed from not wanting to appear 'dumb' or at worst, somehow deficient because I couldn't somehow 'grasp' the precursors to the current thought/concept. Overcoming this, and using a "huh, how'd you get there from that?" approach would particularly powerful for me in my question-asking behaviors going forward.</p>

      <h3>What's good?</h3>

      <p>Where questions that got answered well differentiated from those that didn't get as much attention or went longer without response was in the level of background detail provided. So, in a question that was asking about help with 'somthing not working', those that provided more of a background into how they arrived or how they thought about the problem and where they were, tended to have more of a thoughtful response. This isn't to say that questions where the gist of it was more a quick code check, didn't get attention, it's just that those questions didn't seem as fulfilling. Plus, when the brevity of the question is the goal, the response can suffer from being viewed as curt, even carrying a subcurrent of a patronizing tone. I'm sure it wasn't the intention ont he part of either party, but in the absence of a vocal tone, word choices can be pretty damning.</p>

      <h3>What now?</h3>

      <p>Ultimately, my questions need to carrya  bit of myself in them. That's to say that they need to be better at converying my thought process thus far, and then asking for help or even clarification on whether this is a sound approach that i've undertaken with the current manifestation of the problem, be it code or otherwise, being the entrypoint to the issue. Let's see how this goes!</p>
